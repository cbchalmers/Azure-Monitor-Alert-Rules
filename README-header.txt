 * # Project Details
 *
 * ## Title
 * 
 * Provision Azure Monitor alert rules which are recommended by the [CIS Security Azure Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/).
 *
 * ## Description
 *
 * Collection of Azure Monitor alert rules, as a starting point the current list are recommended by the [CIS Security Azure Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/). Intention is to compile a larger recommendation list over time from different assessment organizations. The list is also easily expandable for any custom requirements within your own organization.
 *
 * #### Resources Provisioned

 * * Action Group for Security Operations Center
 * * Activity Log Alert for Create or Update Security Policy
 * * Activity Log Alert for Create or Update Security Solution
 * * Activity Log Alert for Delete Security Solution
 * * Activity Log Alert for Create or Update Security Group
 * * Activity Log Alert for Delete Network Security Group
 * * Activity Log Alert for Create or Update Network Security Group Rule

 * * Activity Log Alert for Create, Update or Delete SQL Server Firewall Rule
 *
 * ### Prerequisites
 * 
 * * [Download and Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
 * * [Create a Service Principal for Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/service_principal_client_secret.html#creating-a-service-principal)
 *
 * ### Installing
 * 
 * * Populate client_id and client_secret inside main.tf from the Service Principal you created in the prerequisites
 * * Populate subscription_id and tenant_id inside main.tf from your Azure tenant information
 * * Populate resource_location and resource_prefix as appropriate for your environment
 * * Populate resource_tags inside vars.tf with any key:value you want to apply onto the resources
 * * Populate monitor_action_group_soc_full_name, monitor_action_group_soc_short_name and monitor_action_group_soc_email inside vars.tf with your details to receive alert notifications
 *
 * The [terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times
 *
 * ```
 * terraform init
 * ```
 * 
 * The [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files. This command is a convenient way to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state. For example, terraform plan might be run before committing a change to version control, to create confidence that it will behave as expected.
 * 
 * ```
 * terraform plan
 * ```
 * 
 * The [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html) command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.
 * 
 * ```
 * terraform apply
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Removing
 * 
 * The [terraform destroy](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/destroy.html) command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
 * 
 * ```
 * terraform destroy
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Built With
